\begin{abstract}
This study aims to investigate how healthcare sytems are managed within
different economic models. We begin by introducing the management of healthcare
within the two main economic systems: capitalism and socialism. After inspecting the
pros and cons of each system and providing examples of how captialist and Socialist
nations manage their healthcare systems, we then present a bried about Islamic Economics
and how an Isalmic economic system can fill the gaps in healthcare systems and the whole
financial system generally left by capitalism and socialism. However, issues regarding applying
Islamic economics will be discuused. Moreover, Examples that managed to apply successful versions
of the Islamic Model will be presented.
