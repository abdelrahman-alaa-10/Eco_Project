\begin{abstract}
This study investigates how healthcare systems are managed within different economic models. It begins by examining the management of healthcare within the two primary economic systems: capitalism and socialism. After analyzing the pros and cons of each system and providing examples of how capitalist and socialist nations manage their healthcare systems, the study introduces the principles of Islamic economics. It explores how an Islamic economic system can address the gaps in healthcare and the broader financial systems left by capitalism and socialism. Additionally, challenges associated with applying Islamic economics will be discussed, along with examples of successful implementations of the Islamic model.
