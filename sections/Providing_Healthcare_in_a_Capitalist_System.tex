In capitalism, healthcare is provided by private companies. 
People either pay directly for services or buy private insurance. 
This often means that wealthier people can get better care, 
while poorer people may not have access to quality healthcare.
Private companies compete to provide healthcare. 
This can lead to better services and new medical treatments, 
but it can also result in unequal access to care. 
Wealthy people can afford the best services, 
while poorer people may struggle to get the care they need.
