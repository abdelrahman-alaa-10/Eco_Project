In a capitalist system, healthcare is typically provided by private companies. Individuals either pay directly for medical services or purchase private insurance. While this approach allows for competition among private companies, driving innovation and improving the quality of services, it also creates disparities in access to care. Wealthier individuals can afford better healthcare services, while those with limited financial resources may struggle to access even basic medical care. Although competition can result in advancements in medical treatments and technology, it often comes at the cost of unequal access, leaving lower-income populations underserved.
