In socialism, the government owns and runs healthcare. 
It is paid for through taxes, and everyone is entitled to the same 
healthcare services, no matter how much money they have. 
The goal is to ensure that everyone has access to the care they need, 
no matter their income.However, sometimes the government-run 
system can face inefficiencies or shortages in resources, 
making it harder to provide the best care for everyone.
