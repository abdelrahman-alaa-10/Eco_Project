In a socialist system, healthcare is owned and operated by the government and funded through taxes. This ensures that everyone is entitled to the same level of healthcare services, regardless of their income or financial status. The primary goal is to provide universal access to care, promoting equality in healthcare availability. However, government-run systems can sometimes face inefficiencies, such as bureaucratic delays or resource shortages, which may hinder their ability to consistently deliver high-quality care to all individuals.
